        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Kostas Fergadis, a junior aspiring Software Developer
          on the lookout for exciting job opportunities. With a solid foundation
          in both front-end and back-end technologies, I enjoy crafting
          efficient and user-friendly full-stack applications. <br /> <br />{" "}
          With a passion for computers, gaming, and technology since a young
          age, I naturally gravitated towards the programming world. I soon
          discovered a profound interest in programming and decided to delve
          deeper into this fascinating field which led me to a Software
          Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly.
          {/* <br /> <br /> Eager to expand my knowledge and skills, I'm driven by a
          continuous desire to learn, grow, and contribute in the ever-evolving
          landscape of software development. */}
