        <p>
          Hey there! I'm Kostas Fergadis, a junior Software Engineer with a
          background in 3D art and animation, customer service, and sales.
          Fluent in Greek and highly proficient in English, I also hold diplomas
          in French and Japanese.
          <br /> <br /> With a lifelong passion for computers, gaming, and
          technology, I naturally gravitated towards the programming world.
          Through a Software Engineering Immersive course at General Assembly, I
          developed a solid foundation in both front-end and back-end
          technologies. I enjoy creating efficient, user-friendly full-stack
          applications and I'm excited to continue expanding my knowledge and
          contributing my skills.
